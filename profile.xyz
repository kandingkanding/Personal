I am not bitter, I don't have trust issues, I have no barriers or shields, my experiences with relationships have been very positive so far. 

If you value animals more than humans (people) then we are not a match (and probably no human male is).

"I was told I'm nice   several times! :D" 

(skromnost a pokora nejsou ponizovanim se, a silne sebevedomi neni vyvysovat se nad druhe, byt drzy nebo neustupny. Skutecna sila je hluboka, ticha a je videt jen kdyz je to nevyhnutelne) 

was wrong", to express one's true feelings openly, or even to hold the door for a woman of any age. Real men that are strong inside don't have to pretend they are tough and seek approval of badassness from others. It is in a time of great stress or danger that a man can show his strength by being calm, decisive and offer his broad shoulders as a safe harbor for his girl. 

I can admit my own mistakes, appreciate people and express my feelings. 

A man who is isn't afraid to be a man A man who is able to make me feel like a real woman by his side! 

Able to stay calm and composed even in the worst situation 

Being slightly afraid of him, knowing there´s no real harm coming from him. It is the high intelligence and strong passionate personality which make my legs weaken. Together with it goes my fascination with men being conscious of their body... of his body ...let myself be captured. 

I am looking for the serious relationships and the right person for me. 

Playing games with people is immature.   I am mature, I know already what I want and I am not afraid of commitment (question about seeking something to last for the rest of my life) I am already mature 
I am a mature man. I am not turning in circles, not confused, I know what I want and I go for it. I am looking for a friend, a companion, a girlfriend, a partner, a wife, a mother of my children... to grow old together. But that also means I am very serious who I choose, ... I am only looking for my perfect match on all levels (not a perfect woman, I am not perfect or a woman myself, but perfectly matched to me). 

someone who knows how to handle problems in life... I see a reliable man near me, to feel like behind of the stone wall. ... I want to have a strong shoulder in my life 

If you love to go to bars and clubs, then you are not mature yet, go enjoy life, men, shallow existence. If you are totally into fashion, makeup, celebrities, social media… then you are not mature yet. 

being "mature" is about attitude, not about age - mature means not relying on others to solve your problems for you, mature means thinking about consequences of your actions before you do them… you don't have to be perfect, I just have to see that you're trying to be better than yesterday 

Experienced and internally calm / self-dependable / reliable 

Describe plans for my future (this is important - shows clear vision) 

I am highly ambitious - I have ambition to have the best character I can, I have ambition to be the best husband and the best father to my children when the times comes, and I have ambition to earn enough to support my family (which I already do) and to create something good for the world. If you're looking for luxury and high society life, we are too different and not a good match. If you are looking for the best future husband and strong family maybe it's my eyes that you will be looking into for the rest of your life… let's find out 

will start to see a great beauty in ordinary moments - close your eyes and listen to the sound of raindrops falling, smell of fresh air as you take a deep breath, symphony of different tastes in new food you are trying, electrifying touch of your partner's hand in your hair. Embrace every experience as if you're doing it for the very first time. Life is the most precious 

Woman: Being very passionate about something is a huge plus. 

Woman: Necessary attributes are reliability, positive attitude and strong will to improve oneself every day. 

I like to put myself out of my comfort zone because I have found that is the most effective way to grow as a person And i would love to discover this wonderful amazing world with my loved man together, who challenges me to be a better person. 

If you have a feeling we could help each other grow 

self-determined I would like to meet a MAN, who is happy in his life, with huge vision of future and not afraid to go ahead to reach his global goals. knows what he wants AND makes it happen 

No laziness. Lazy people never achieve anything important in life, be it exercise, diet, school, career, business or just sharing household with a lazy person is a nightmare. 

shallow interactions. If I messaged you, I really mean it. Let’s see if we can make it work… who knows, maybe we meet as soulmates here... life is full of surprises 

When I decide to spend time with loved ones, I am 100% there, not checking my email, texting or thinking about other things, I give my whole self to the moment. Our 

No food lovers / food focused people / love cooking and eating 

I never drink alcohol and I don't smoke. I follow extremely healthy nutrition (nothing baked, grilled, fried, no flour, potatoes, rice, corn or any kind of meat, no chemical additives, conservatives, flavors, colors, or anything processed for that matter... just boiled or steamed vegetables and raw fruits with nuts) or as my parents call it "eating grass" :) All this gives me such immense strength and sense of vitality that I

Lifestyle & Drugs   (Drugs? Smoking? Alcohol? Healthy diet? Vegetarian / Vegan? Exercise?) 

Do you try to eat healthy, or do you just eat whatever you feel like? 

Mind, body and heart have to be in balance. If you are strong unique personality and have interesting mind, then just talking to you will stimulate my mind and fill it with a thousand thoughts. This will take over my mind. If you are a good girl that is caring, loving and with a kind heart, then I will feel happiness and tranquility just by being in your life. This will take over my heart. If you are very attractive, feminine and know how to be beautiful inside and out, then just by being in your presence will electrify me with a throbbing passion. This will take over my body, the animal within. All three have to be in symphony. 

I am a sucker for flat stomach, long skinny legs and large full lips …with exotic features 

And of course there has to be physical attraction, otherwise we're just friends. 

Large lips and large mouth Clean strong white teeth 

Women have evolutionary mechanism that activates your chemistry (butterflies in the stomach, strong feelings) based on man's personality traits more than appearance, like confidence, strength of personality, authority (expand to explain you understand attraction) because this was important for survival of their babies. Men did not need any of those traits in women to maximize their genetic survival, so nature wired men to be attracted to physical traits like genetic quality (natural beauty), strong health (fit body) and fertility (age, hips, breasts). Do not expect men to be physically attracted to your personality. You make our mind fall in love with your beautiful mind and our hearts fall in love with your loving heart… but only your body can make fall in love our body. 

You can be angry at us for it… but it is as much out of our control to change it as is yours to feel strong chemistry for that awkward too nice guy who follows you everywhere in life like a puppy. 

Woman who understands beauty as (healthy food + fitness + good sleep + hygiene) and not as (makeup + chemical cosmetics + jewelry + clothes + shoes + Botox) 

I have lived with my body for 36 years and I've learned how to listen to it over the years. Now I know exactly what turns on my chemistry and what doesn't. I know exactly what look will spark very strong physical attraction. I know exactly what I need and I am looking for it. 

No woman wants a man that is not physically attracted to her. It would never bring 

If I sent you message first, it means I have a feeling you might be that special one who can spark my chemistry and I want to find out more. (limited or dishonest pictures mean I might be wrong) 

I love nature in all forms and climates, you don't have to be a world class athlete, but if you can't be bothered to walk 1 km, because "it's too far", then we are not a good match 

I do not own or watch TV, radio, I never read magazines or popular webs 

I do not like bars, clubs, alcohol, smoke, shopping or city nightlife 
I don't go to bars, clubs, pubs, or even to most cultural events - if you live for the "social game" then I am sorry, we are not a good match (you wouldn't be satisfied either) 

When I decide to spend time with loved ones, I am 100% there, not checking my phone, texting or thinking about other things, I give my whole self to the moment. Our time is so precious, yet we divide it into million small things and 

I am not looking for a Barbie, princess, Instagram celebrity, trophy wife or queen of social events … I am looking for the smart girl next door, with whom I can watch a movie, play a game, read a book together, watch TED talk, walk in nature, or just explore all the hidden places while traveling around the world. 

Lord of The Rings, Hobbit and Asimov's Foundation series), all the things I read in the day have educational character but span many different fields. I love academic psychology, Cognitive Sciences, Artificial Intelligence, physics technology, health, medicine, business and entrepreneurship 

I don't ever watch TV or even own one, I don't read about celebrities or what's happening in the social world, and I don't browse other people's updates on social media to kill time… my time is precious and very limited, I want to spend it with real people that are actually close to me… on the other hand, I always have time for my partner, when you're talking to me, I will always be focused on you and you only, I am always present in the moment) 

I am not compatible with types who are into: Art (except literature, cinematography, documentary, opera), fashion, modeling, pageants, makeup, clubbing, lots of interest into boys, over the top romantic books / movies / series, celebrities, status, luxury, 

No fashion designers, artists and similar. I am looking essentially for a "Nerd girl who cares about how she looks by diet and exercise, not clothes and makeup". Nerd + fitness girl / healthy lifestyle + Nature. 

Physics, computers, space exploration, relativity, quantum world, Divadlo, opera. 

Scientific mind - sceptic 

Thoughts: What is the meaning of life if it has no meaning and how meaning itself is just a construct of Humans. How shatteringly insignificant we are in the grand of the universe and how little do we know how far it stretches beyond the veil of microwave background. How to comprehend with my jungle-evolved monkey brain the duality of energy and matter, wave and particle. How do different people feel in different situations (sharpening empathy). If this list made you think about the next year's fashion trends... we do not have the same level of curiosity about the world. 

Primitivism - thinking just about make-up, celebrities, intrigues, who hates you and who posted what … instead of meaning of life, humanity, the world, science 

Determinism and human free will. / Nature of quantum particles. / How long can financial bubble grow without exploding and maybe it's a good thing in the end. / How to transcend my human limitations and be something more. / How many watermelons can I eat without dying. 

these things come with age, but you have to have burning passion to grow, to be better and discipline 

I absolutely require a man to be intelligent (in my experience this doesn’t always relate to academic degrees), objective, open minded My partner should be curious of life 

I absolutely love knowledge. If you're passionate about everything around us and have this unquenchable hunger to understand how every single part of this world works, then we are of the same blood and we would be a great match. If you just read because you have to or study because of your parents, then we would be a terribly bad match for each other. 

keen sense of a world outside of your own 

- At least basic curiosity about the world (will grow with education) - I will show you the universe through my eyes, you will see the wonder that surrounds us and you will never ever say that science is boring. It's the most miraculous and fantastic thing I know. 

Are you an intellectual? In the context of this question, intellectual means someone who loves learning, often for its own sake. Do you enjoy finding out what makes things work the way they do? Outside of work and school, how inclined are you to investigate something that interests you? 

indoctrinated by unproven theories about invisible sky wizard stated as facts quickly 

- Non religious, non-esoteric 

Aren't conservative or overly religious, nationalist, racist, prejudiced or excusing such mindset by claiming to just be 'old-fashioned'. 

Is your duty to religion/God the most important thing in your life? 

With age comes wisdom. Time is the most valuable resource we have, not money. Health is the most valuable asset we cannot afford to lose. 

Knowledgeable rather than wise, rational rather than intuitive and consistent rather than chaotic. 

Values: In the west, we damage ourselves with our AMBITION, GREED We want stuff, and we want a lot of stuff... always more... ALWAYS... and when we don't get everything as expected, we are frustrated and think our life has failed We forget what we have... we always only see what we still don't have... But we swim in an ocean of opportunities... there will always be more things we don't have… 

and jump from one extreme to another. People who see solid moderate result and they say "It's boring!". I value quality over entertainment (and I totally understand if someone doesn't, it's just not suitable for lifetime relationship (*rewrite, so it doesn't 

I am a rationalist. Means I do not subscribe to any fanatical ideas, ideologies or dogmas, like any religion, any patriotism, racism, culturalism or any modern movements. I evaluate every situation independently, every person independently, and make rational conclusions based on that specific situation. (**rewrite, make it shorter and more comprehensive, less brag) 

qualities of it… needless to say, such a car doesn't sell very well … character references upon request (3 out of 3 of my exes would recommend me to my new girlfriend :D ) 

work between us, it will just bring pain // simple version: I am EXTREMELY open person, I have no secrets, and I am looking for as open person as possible too 

I don't do disconnected relationships. When I'm in a relationship I become one with my other partner, all our thoughts are shared, your thoughts become part of me and my thoughts become part of you - we become one mind two bodies, there is no you and me, there are no fights, no drama, no jealousy, no ego, we act as one. This has worked for me in the past and I cannot imagine having any other relationship than this. 

I'm only open to meaningful, honest, and exclusive relationships with likeminded people. 

her life is secured (I understand it, it's just not me). I don't want a plain jane "average" or "simple" girl that likes music, arts, movies, makeup and shopping. I need someone with more depth, more color, and more quirks. Someone with very unique personality. I want a woman who is already living a very good fulfilling life (or 

in the process of building it right now!) and just want an equal partner (which equally good fulfilling life) to share these moments together, support each other and help each other grow on the way through life. 

I understand there are not many women like this… but I don't need many, I need only 

Everything in the profile is true, and yes, I am 36, never been married and have no children, and yes I am looking for a serious relationship, but …   No dark past, nobody to haunt me, no unfinished business from the past and no emotional baggage, no baggage from the past, no sexual insecurities. 

I am singe, never been married and have no children. I am looking for the same. 

My highest values in life: 1.  Health                                         <= Physical 2.  Love (Relationship / Family)       <= Emotional 

My man will be always number one in my life. My man will always be my best friend, my adviser, and my partner in everything. I believe in family values and I dream to find a man who wants to have happy family life with one woman. I am interested only in real love and strong long lasting relations. 

not afraid to express his romantic, passionate side someone that can express what he feel, and that is able to show his love no just to talk 

No social media / approval Stable, emotionally mature, emotionally available, and have decent EQ Sensitive   No emotional baggage   Someone who is not complicated (I am complex, nut complicated) My emotional life is very clean and healthy

dictionary. The advantage is that you can be yourself with me. The deepest truest self. No social masks, no filters, no intrigue, no drama, just open and relax like a child. I am very open with almost all my thoughts, even to strangers. I have no fear of them abusing it. I don't take myself seriously enough to be hurt by almost anything anyone can say to me. If you are the opposite (a snowflake) it is very bad idea to be even my friend. 

Not afraid of darkness and silence - not afraid of my own thoughts

interest. Don't worry, I can handle it all. I just need you to be genuine and honest.   

I can bring emotional stability to your life, to (**list what plagues girls these days if I can honestly fix it**)… what will you bring to my life? 

I have a weakness for people with strong mature personality, emotional stability and inner peace. 

I have no EGO. 

Spoiled - Hard to please - Drama queens - Self-centered, selfish and insecure 

Seeking approval - constantly posting on social media and checking likes Narcissism - taking selfies 

to be mature woman, not a child, not a princess, not immature. 

I do not match well with people who have big Ego - if you care who messaged first, who had the last word, who was "right", or take everything personal - we are not a good match 

If you are diva, princess or need special treatment, love finer things in life (luxury) or you are obsessed with pretentious social events and care about what others think about you… I would kindly redirect you to neighboring profiles. I am looking for down to earth normal woman - wife material (p.s. you don't have to know how to cook) 

happiness, even if it means without you. To be jealous means to want what's best for you, at the expense of partner's happiness. I believe the best way to retain your partner is the opposite of restriction - give total freedom, independence, let her or him grow and focus on growing yourself by being the best partner possible. If you love a beautiful flower, you don't cut it and take it with you, wanting to own and possess will only kill it, that is jealousy and self-love. If you truly love a beautiful flower, you will water it and care for it. Love is not about owning and possession, love is about appreciation and care. Don't be jealous, learn to let go and you will never be alone. 

Princess, queen, bitch, model attitude: Attitude is like spice, a little bit of attitude is ok, but too much comes off as emotionally unstable attempt to compensate internal insecurities by acting like a bitch, diva or a princess. I am not looking for a spoiled little princess to adopt, I am looking for a grown up woman warrior, that will stand by my side in battle. 

Not assuming things (domyslavost) 

Approval   (Social media whoring? Obsessed with your image? Handle criticism?  Social resistance / peer pressure? Winning vs Having fun? Depression? Mental illness? Jealous? Unstable?) How often do you use social media? Are you concerned with your image and the way others perceive you? How well do you handle criticism? Do you give in easily when pressured? When playing games with friends, which is more important to you? (Winning) / (Having fun) / (Neither, don't play) / (no friends) 

I specialize in bringing out the best in others 

understands the art of listening He must also be patient and willing to listen to me. 

I am not really an optimist. I am more of a "happy realist". I see the world for what it truly is, but I am still happy about it. 

**I have no mask, I never wear one, I am always my deepest self, never afraid to say my true feelings to anyone, never afraid to talk about all the details of my life to a stranger, I hide nothing, I am not afraid to trust people and I do… nothing bad had ever came out of it… I believe people who are not trustworthy usually do not trust the first… mistrust to others then just calls for mutual mistrust… people usually attract what they are themselves secretly inside** 

I like a man who is nice and gentle, but has a wild side at right moments. 

Friendly, broad minded, very open and talkative (woman)

Loyal - the undying loyalty of a wife that sticks with the husband even when he has nothing and the whole world is against him Fidelity - being faithful even when she is a star and has hundreds of options every day   I have never cheated on any girl in my entire life, I haven't even lied to one   (honor) Your feelings are safe with me

I can support my future family and as a real man I will. But if you're looking for something more, like luxury and expensive gifts, then close this window and look elsewhere, I wish you the best of luck to find the man you desire. However if you're looking for true love, where two minds share everything and become one, where… (elaborate) 

Financially Responsible   I do not need much for myself, for me wealth important only to be able to provide stability for my future family. 

I accept my role as a man (hint: I am not a feminist), I will support my future family with everything I have. … That being said, I am not generous to strangers, and most certainly not your 'free dinner' date-victim ;) 

Money   (Money vs Principles? Money buy happiness? Peace on Earth vs Money? Sex  for money? Modest? Billionaire? Expensive gifts? Are you careful with your money?) 

It may seem that I have an answer for everything, but the truth is I don't. I am just like you - a person trying to find a place in this world. I am not special, only unique, but the world is full of unique people. I don't think I am a star and I am not looking for a star either. Just a normal woman - modest and humble - with healthy confidence and realistic self-reflection. 

that's why it’s important to me and should be important to you too. I am also not looking for my future ex-wife. 

I love being silly and laughing so definitely seeking a man who also doesn't take himself or life overly serious all the time.

Je-li žena naštvaná, obejměte ji a řekněte jí, jak je krásná. Vrčí-li dál, ustupte do bezpečné vzdálenosti a hoďte jí čokoládu.

If you have a dog and you think it's your baby and it means everything to you, then we are not a match. Same applies as above for single mothers - you are a single mother (by choice) and that dog will always come first. 

Yes, the pictures are real! (I don't have illusions about my appearance. I just keep grooming so I can pass as a Human :) ) 

Do not write me first, instead click Interest. I go through all Interests and if I see that we can be physically compatible, I read the profile, if I think we are a good match mentally, I write to you first.   You read this far before messaging me because you care about more than how I look. 

click "Interest". I go through all my interests, so I will find you, I will look at your profile thoroughly and read all the text you wrote there and then if I think we have a very high chance of being right for each other, I will write you the first message myself. 

======================================================================= 

LOOKING 
I choose quality over quantity. I don’t spam dozens of people with messages, I just pick the very special one and try to connect on a deeper level, no shallow interactions. If I messaged you, I really mean it. Let’s see if we can make it work...

Do not write me first, instead click Interest. I go through all Interests and if I see that we can be physically compatible, I read the profile, if I think we are a good match mentally, I write to you first. 

You read this far before messaging me because you care about more than how I look. 

Have filled out your profile, otherwise why not just use Tinder. 

How willing are you to meet someone from OKCupid in person? 

It is not humanly possible for me to answer all the 100+ messages per day, I have a life to live! :) and I am looking only for one! However I don’t want to waste your time. So it's better if you don't write first message to me (to not waste your time), instead click "Interest". I go through all my interests, so I will find you, I will look at your profile thoroughly and read all the text you wrote there and then if I think we have a very high chance of being right for each other, I will write you the first message myself. 
However, if you think we are like long-lost-twins, perfect for each other as friends, then by all means, send me a message! (start the message with word "Friendship" so I know you read my whole profile) 

Of course if I messaged you first already, then I see a great potential in you. *rephrase* 

Don't give up, I know that a lot of people are not serious (men and women), but there are always exceptions... and you need to find just one.

DEAL BREAKERS 


We are not a match if: // Why we might not be a good match for each other: 
• Age: No restriction on age, but I want children sometime in the future, so there's that - fertility 
• Kids: Have kids 
• Dogs: Have dogs (I understand it, you love your dog beyond anything, it's your baby. There is nothing wrong with that, but for all intents and purposes you are a single mother. Your heart already belongs to someone. 
• Smoking: Smoker 
• Religion: Religious 
• Fat: Average+ (anything above Slim) 
• Tattoo: Chest tattoo, sleeve, large tattoos (tattoos are graffiti for the body) (I have never seen an attractive tattoo in my life / don't be afraid to use word: ugly) (it's fashionable, everybody is doing it so you have to do it too / to fit in) (no self-respecting emotionally-stable adult would put what is essentially a graffiti on their body) (you don't put graffiti on the walls… so why something as irreplaceable as body?) (you're desperately trying to be different… in the very same way as all others are trying to be different… sheep) (It's not feminine or sexy to me even though it's 90% of the girls I know.) 
- Someone with poor impulse control (Girls with poor-impulse control are almost always sluts...Not wife material!). 
- Someone with zero future time orientation; that shit looks plenty different when she's 23 than it will at 43 (Girls with no future-time orientation will have no problem fleecing you in a divorce with little regard for the long-term future of your children and negative-regard for your own long-term future...Not wife material!). 
- Someone who craves attention to the point that she'll spend hundreds of dollars to permanently mangle her skin (Attention whores are either sluts or teases, and if there's one thing I like less than a slut, it's a tease [at least sluts are fun]...Not wife material!). 
- Someone who thinks she's 'unique and special' when she is in fact doing something that at least 23% of her peer group has done (Special Snowflake Syndrome, though in the west it's a pandemic...Not wife material!). 
- Someone who with each thing she gets done becomes an increased risk for Hepatitis C, tetanus and even HIV (Not only are these diseases bad, but once you have them, if they can even be cured, it's such a bitch...Not wife material!). 
Nowadays you're more special NOT having a tattoo than having full sleeves.

I cannot get physically attracted to a girl with tattoos (except maybe a small one hidden somewhere) 
Good mother to her children 
It's the herd effect - you see five other people in your social circle doing and you get unstoppable need to do the same thing - like any good sheep. 
Seeking approval, unquenchable thirst for attention and approval from others - have to put it on display for others (tattoo on their skin) 
• Piercing: Facial piercing 
• Children: Don't want any children (except when she is 18-28) 

• Gold-digger / Love luxury and brands / focused on money in life 
• Art is center of your life 
• Not careful with your money / can't control spending / has no savings 
• Fragile / snowflake / emotional problems / personal demons / insecurities 
• Feminist (militant) / "strong woman" - In my experience people who say "Real men are not afraid of strong women!" usually have unbearable combative personality. Most men are not afraid of strength, but sharing life with someone who fights you every single day is tiring and not attractive at all. (give them lecture about bashing men in their profile description is like talking about how bad your ex treated you on the first date - it speaks volumes about you) 

(Please don't take it personal and get all angry about it, because it is not, we all have different tastes and preferences. I don't mind any of the things listed above in my friends. But for a lifetime relationship I want my best possible match. I still wish you best of luck in your search! And I'm not just saying it, I really mean it.) 

Just a side note: 
A lot of girls here: fake eyelashes, fake eye color, fake skin (makeup), fake lip color (lipstick), fake hair (extensions), fake breast size (pushup bra), lying top-down angled pictures, beautifying filters, lying about weight, height, kids… but then write "looking for a REAL man". 
Put fake and you will only attract fake liars back who play games with you, as you are with them. 
Consider putting real information and real pictures and you will attract a real man
